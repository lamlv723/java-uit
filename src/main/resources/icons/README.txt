All SVG icons here are lightweight, hand-crafted outline symbols inspired by the mockup design.
Naming: kebab-case, logical concept (no trademark shapes copied).
Usage examples (Java):
  Icon dash = IconFactory.get("chart-line", 24);
  JLabel lbl = new JLabel(IconName.CHECK_CIRCLE.icon(16));

Add new: create 24x24 viewBox, keep strokes ~1.6-2, prefer #1877F2 as primary accent.
